# dateFormatter
Working with dates in JavaScript can be challenging. You have to navigate various methods, formats, and time zones. In this project, I learned how to work with the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties. I also learned how to correctly format dates.

This project covers concepts such as the getDate(), getMonth(), and getFullYear() methods.
